# 🧹 AntiVis (Anti Visual Indexes)

A robust C# Console Application designed to automate the removal of specific text strings (or "indexes") from `.sql` and `.txt` files.

Built to streamline workflows by eliminating repetitive manual deletion of text patterns. Includes a persistent clipboard feature to copy cleaned text directly to system memory.

## 🚀 Features

* **Targeted Removal:** Strip any specific string or index from a file instantly.
* **Smart Pathing:** Automatically detects if a file is in the local directory or requires a full system path.
* **Flexible Output:**
    * 💾 **Save to New File:** Keeps the original data safe.
    * 📝 **Overwrite:** Updates the current file instantly.
    * 📋 **Copy to Clipboard:** Copies cleaned text to the system clipboard (persists even after the app closes).
* **Visual Interface:** Custom ASCII UI for a clean user experience.

## 📥 Installation & Usage (For Users)

**No coding knowledge required.**

1.  Go to the **[Releases](../../releases)** page (on the right sidebar).
2.  Download the latest `.zip` or `.exe` file.
3.  Run `deleting_visible.exe`.
4.  Follow the on-screen instructions:
    * **Step 1:** Enter the string/index you want to remove.
    * **Step 2:** Enter the filename (e.g., `database.sql`).
    * **Step 3:** Choose your output method.
