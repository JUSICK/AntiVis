# 🧹 AntiVis (Anti Visual Indexes)

A lightweight yet powerful **C# Console Application** designed to automatically remove specific text patterns (“indexes”) from `.sql` and `.txt` files.

AntiVis helps developers and database administrators streamline workflows by eliminating repetitive manual cleanup. Includes a persistent clipboard feature so cleaned text is available instantly — even after the app closes.

## 🚀 Features

### 🔍 Targeted Removal
Remove any specific string or index from a file instantly.

### 📁 Smart Path Detection
The program automatically checks if your file is in the local directory or requires a full path.

### 📤 Flexible Output Options
Choose how you want to handle the cleaned text:
- 💾 **Save to a New File** — preserve the original  
- 📝 **Overwrite Existing File** — apply changes directly  
- 📋 **Copy to Clipboard** — text stays saved even after exit  

### 🎨 Visual Interface
Custom ASCII-styled UI for a clean, readable console experience.
